WHAT’S THIS ALL ABOUT

Mary Joe Frug’s “Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook”

This project is a postmodern analysis of gender in Knapp, Crystal, and Prince’s Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials. Problems in Contract Law is an American contracts casebook that attempts, in good faith and with a commercial incentive, to relay the current state and relevant history of American contract law to first-year law students. The opinions 

This is a descriptive project, but is necessarily political, and comes with a heavy normative undertone. This project compares the ways in which women, as a political population, appear in the casebook differently from men. Most Americans expected women not to participate in the government or the formal economy from the country’s inception to the early twentieth century, and not to occupy public positions of capitalist power until the middle of the twentieth century. There is a massive historical disparity in the relative power of women in public   (again, as a political population) and men (the same), that is slowly edging towards parity according mostly to economic metrics. 

For better or worse, the casebook does represent this dynamic. This is not a total denunciation of the casebook editors’ choices. Presenting these inequalities accurately reflects the general exclusion of women from public life and contracts law for most of American history. The limited universe of American contracts presented in a this casebook provide an interesting venue to examine a snapshot of flawed, gendered, improving, complicated law.  

20 of 103 cases, or nearly 1 in 5,  were decided before 1965, when a federal law prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin finally came into effect and the U.S. ceased legally being a racial apartheid state. 73 of the 103 cases, or just under 3 in 4, were decided before the 21st century.  

Much to the detriment of this project’s usefulness, race is not as measurable in the casebook as gender. There are few people who have names that are clearly European in origin; some of the people with European names are likely to be people of color. Nevertheless, white people likely occupy an enormous proportion of characters in the book. My inability to measure that disparity makes most of this analysis very misleading colorblind. It’s difficult to balance an acknowledgement of white supremacy, and thus the general assumption that most people privileged enough to engage in lawsuits were white for most of American history and continue to be disproportionately white.

Theoretical framework: Why Frug? 

First, I analyze what Frug describes as “woman as characters:” concrete analysis of the individual women in the casebook, how judges choose to write about them, and how editors choose to frame them.   
Second, I analyze, in Frug’s words, the “abstract characteristics which we commonly attribute to men [and women] and characteristics of the casebook.” Most interestingly, many businesses in the casebook have a name that communicates masculinity, either through a gendered first name, Bros., or fictional characters like Hercules.
