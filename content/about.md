This is a test website for the project of Frugging KCP's Contract Law: Theories and Alternatives. 

I built the site using R, Hugo, and Netlify. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
